üè¥‚Äç CREATIVE PRESS PLATFORM
- Project carried out in Laravel
Through the CREATIVE PRESS platform it is possible to write articles, view them, modify them and delete them. The tests were carried out through simulations via faker / seeder and the interface was customized via blade / scss. In the second release of the app, the possibility of uploading images (via upload and not via url) and automatic notification by sending an email when a new article is published on the platform has been included.
